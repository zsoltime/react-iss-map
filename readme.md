# React ISS Map

React ISS map showing the current position of the [International Space Station](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html) on Google Maps updated every 5 seconds. If you leave the app open for 90 minutes you can see how the station orbits the earth.

The app uses the [Open APIs from Space](http://open-notify.org/) to fetch the position and the number of people in space.
